## Video Game Character Controller (Custom FSM Interactor)
The video game character controller is a custom FSM interactor aimed to emulate the feeling of top-down video game movement. 

### How to use:
- Hover over the single arrows to face a direction
- Hover over double arrows to "walk" in a direction.
- Hover in the centre to reach an "Idle Stage"
- It "saves" the state you were in when exiting outside a traditional control
